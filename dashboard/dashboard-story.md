We have looked to find whether or not there was any significant discrepancies between the transaction amounts of genders and whether or not this may have an influence on customer churning

We came to find that though female numbers where greater in each pool, there was no significant differences.

Despite this, with females numbers being larger, consideration may be paid to this gender group when deducing efforts to reduce attrition.
